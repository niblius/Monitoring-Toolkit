Monitoring toolkit for web developers is an android application that
allows users to continuously track their websites: check accessibility, ping
and correctness of server response. User can watch logs and receive notifications
about any problems. The application supports various settings allowing to
tune the smallest details of its work:intervals between checks, how to react
on failures, even set up the night time, when notifications are unwanted.
Other usual features for mobile applications, like importing settings,
exporting logs and so on, are also included.
